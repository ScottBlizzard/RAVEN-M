summary_prompt = '''You are exploring what functions an App has. Your task is to constantly record the experience gained from the latest exploration and continuously update and summarize the experience gained. And keep recording the functions supported by the page.

### Requirements
1. The recorded experience needs to be concise, but the key points should be highlighted, such as the specific meanings of different colors or buttons;
2. It is necessary to record what actions were performed and what effects were produced and the functions supported by the page;
3. The description of the previous and next pages can be detailed or brief.
4. Do not include words such as "possible issue" in the experience records.


The latest explored page is as follows:
<|vision_start|><|image_pad|><|vision_end|>
After taking the following action {action_1}, the following page is obtained:
<|vision_start|><|image_pad|><|vision_end|>

Summary of experience of previously explored content -before_summary:
{before_summary}

You need to summarize all main functions on the page and determine whether to update before_summary based on the most recent exploration step.

### Output format
1. If the experience summarized in the most recent step has similar points recorded in before_summary, there is no need to update it and output False
2. If before_summary is None or you think it needs to be updated, please output the updated experience summary in the format of <exp>1, ...\n2, ...</exp>.
3. Note! After the update, do not lose the important function description information in before_summary! !
4. Do not use the word "page" directly. You need a more specific description such as: App main page, page after clicking setting, etc.'''
